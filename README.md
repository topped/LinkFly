# LinkFly
This used to be sold on CodeCanyon, but due to time restraints and other I have decided to open-source it. Feel free to commit changes, leave feedback, etc...

## What is it?
This lets you build your own AdFly-like service and make money of it.

This comes with a bunch of features, most notably:
* Campaign hosting
* Link previews with ads (banner/interstitial)
* Full, extensive admin panel
* Fund management
* Withdrawal Services
* Translated Pages
* Custom Pages
* Registration/Login
* Modular Theme using Smarty
* ...more

## Install
Check out the Documentation folder, it'll tell you everything.

## Notice
Yes, I did not use a framework to make this. Yes, I realize it's not a good design and it might be full of bugs, so feel free to help out.
